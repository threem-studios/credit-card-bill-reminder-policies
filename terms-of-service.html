The Application may request permission to send notifications in order to remind you of upcoming bill due dates.
</p>

<p>
The Service Provider does not guarantee that notifications will always be delivered on time or at all, as delivery may be affected by device settings, operating system behavior, battery optimization, or other factors outside the Service Provider’s control.

All data entered into the Application, such as bill details and reminder dates, is stored locally on your device. The Service Provider does not collect or store user data on external servers.
</p>

<p>
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against rooting or modifying your device, as doing so may compromise security and cause the Application to malfunction.
